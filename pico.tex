    \item \textbf{Background} This solution is designed to create a quick and simple method of converting and analysing various forms of data.
\vspace{.3cm}
    \item \textbf{Intention:} The goal of my proof of concept is to utilise a combination of tools and scripts to effectively convert multiple data types into a single file format for subsequent text analysis in three steps.
\vspace{.3cm}
    \item \textbf{Applicability:} This solution will be of use to any research that combines data from audio, literature and personally gathered information such as field notes and finds value in analysing these sources together.
\vspace{.3cm}
    \item \textbf{Significance:} Allows for comparative textual analysis of multiple sources of data such as audio, notes and academic literature. It combines these three sources together with minimal steps, effort and can be performed on multiple files without issue.
\vspace{.3cm}
    \item \textbf{Execution:} The process requires the use of Ubuntu's Windows distribution to link software: Joplin, xPDF, Mozilla Deepspeech. Voyant Server is then utilised to analyse the results.

1. Place audio files into the interviews folder and PDF files into the articles folder\\

2. Open Ubuntu and execute the script that transcribes audio with Mozilla Deepspeech, converts PDFs using xPDF, exports fieldnotes from Joplin, and places all files within the Ready folder\\

3. Open Voyant Server and select all files within Ready for analysis
